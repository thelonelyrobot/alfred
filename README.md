Good ol' Alfred Pennyworth, now through facebook messenger.

## Details

Alfred is a facebook messenger bot created solely for personal automation. Currently, the features I am thinking of adding to Alfred are:

- Weather updates (through [Dark sky](https://darksky.net/dev/) api)
- MIT Tech shuttle updates (through [NextBus](https://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) API)
- Class updates (through [google calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/) or just by having the schedule somewhere.)
- Goodreads random quote (through goodreads embedding.)
- Map API, probably.
- MIT dining details, possibly through scraping.

It is possible to automate a lot of this through Google assistant, but I am looking for more class and more options for personalization.
